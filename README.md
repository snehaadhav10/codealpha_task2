# CodeAlpha_MusicGenerationAI

This project uses LSTM to generate music from MIDI files.

Steps:
1. Collect MIDI files
2. Preprocess using music21
3. Prepare note sequences
4. Train an LSTM model
5. Generate music
6. Convert to MIDI

Requirements:
- music21
- keras
- numpy

Run each script in order to reproduce the project.
